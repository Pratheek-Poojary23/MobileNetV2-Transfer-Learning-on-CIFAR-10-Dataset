## ðŸ§  Model Summary

This project uses the **MobileNetV2** architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet, as a **feature extractor**, followed by custom dense layers to classify CIFAR-10 images into 10 categories:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **CIFAR-10** dataset from `tf.keras.datasets.cifar10`
- 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels), 10 classes
  - 50,000 training images
  - 10,000 test images
